/**
 * Abstract model of a console.
 * 
 * A Console, as modeled by this interface, mainly consists of a buffer
 * containing a line of text that can be arbitrarily modified and finaly
 * comitted. In addition, a console produces output, which can be recieved by
 * registering an apropiate listener with this console. Note that the model by
 * itself does not support any buffering of the produced output.
 * 
 * As an (optional) feature, a console may support two different kinds of input
 * processing: the "normal" mode is described above, the alternative is the
 * so-called "single char" mode. When in single char mode, the underlying
 * streams expect character-wise unbuffered input via the putSingleChar(char)
 * method.
