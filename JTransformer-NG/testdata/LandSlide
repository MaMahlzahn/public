nothing to explain
 whenever you're around me 
 the silence's still astounding
 unshadowed by distress or overcasting anger
 we're lucky if the landslide hit's us hard on time;
 our rose-lipped youth is passing by
 so easy that it's hard
 walking on a faultline,spending all the dreamtime
 waiting for the landslide to hit home
 so those self-seeking satellites stop spinning 'round
 and are forced to choose a different course
 who would wanna know?
 if you're not gonna show
 how the crazy gift of time takes it's toll...
 
 Impress me and say that you will put it straight
 wipe off the residue and clean the slate
 go get a grip before it's all too late
 all and everythings at stake.
 
 too proud to let you know (nothing to explain)
 I tried to prove you wrong (no need to complain)
 but there's a consolation : 
 the gravity's increasing (nothing to explain whenever you're around me)
 since you've been around
 the self-seeking satellites stopped spinning 'round
 can't find no joke to fend you off
 who would wanna know?
 if you're not gonna show
 how the crazy gift of time takes it's toll...
 
 Impress me and say that you will put it straight
 wipe off the residue and clean the slate
 go get a grip before it's all too late
 all and everythings at stake:
 more than anyone can take!
