 * As there might be several (conflicting) notions or strategies of determining
 * the "active" or "current" PrologInterface at a given point in time, I decided
 * to attach a name to each of this strategies and let the user decide which one
 * to use.
 * 
 * Clients who are interested in finding out or following the currently "active"
 * PrologInterface should check with the ContextTrackerService to obtain a list
 * of all contributed strategies and either choose one that seems fitting or
 * even beter: ask the user.
 * 
 * Clients can overide this Interface to contribute their own
 * PrologContextTracker strategy and make it available to other clients by
 * registering it at the PrologRuntimePlugin's ContextTrackerService. Typically
 * this is done by extending the extension point prologContextTracker of the
 * pdt.runtime plugin.
