 * Intended to enable flexible management of resources in situations
 * where it is not feasable to abstract from the filesystem (e.g. by 
 * using the jdk's resource api.)
 * <p>
 * RFLs resolve relative path strings to File instances. (see resolve(String)). 
 * instead of resolving a path string, RFLs can also create so-called
 * sub-locators for that path. .   
 * <p>
 * Concrete motivation: We want to bootstrap the prolog system.
 * Filesystem seems to be the most simple and relyable way to supply the
 * server side (prolog) implementation of the prolog interface. 
 *  <p>
 *  Alternative: Should be possible to use tcp streams for this.
 *  Might be an elegant alternative, but atm, i do not see that elegance would
 *  justify the additional complexity.
 *  <p>
 *  comment: i would apreciate another solution. i cannot help feeling that this is
 *  somewaht redundant.
