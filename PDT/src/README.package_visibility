This is the general contract behind internal vs public packages:

An packge fragment "internal" marks its respective sub tree as non-public.
Classes inside this sub tree may only be referenced from classes belonging 
to the sub tree or to the parent package of the "internal" 


a package violating the above conditions should be viewed as faulty.
Since all above conditions can be checked staticaly, their violation should
be regarded as a compile-time error.
It would be realy cool to have e.g. a tool like cultivate auto-check 
the above conditions.
